Hummly
======
Everyone sings in the shower. With Hummly, you can anonymously contribute to crowd-sourced covers of your favorite songs.
Have a great Freddie Mercury, or a killer Hendrix guitar impression? Hummly dynamically overlays your covers on top of 
everyone else's, creating a beautiful tune. Using Rdio, we have access to millions of songs. The next time you are humming to 
yourself, or singing when your roommates are gone, use Hummly!
